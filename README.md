👋 Hi, I’m @Khel-Ileto  
👀 I’m interested in web development, fitness, and philosophy, especially topics like Stoicism and self-improvement.  
🌱 I’m currently learning Java programming and advanced database systems.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects that focus on functional, monochromatic black-themed designs and coding solutions that integrate both front-end and back-end technologies.  
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me through my GitHub profile or email.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy combining my passion for coding with fitness tracking—building my own gym progress tracking tools on my personal website!
